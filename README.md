# WordPress-plugin-plugins-calendar-bookings

I am looking for some WordPress plugin (plugins?) which helps me to create some kind of market with bookings feature (and paying options). 
Every registered user could have add product/offer to market and let regular users booking those products for hours. 
This plugin should be compatible with calendar (every registered user should have own calendar/bookings).
Registered user should be able to edit profile, add items with attributes. Iâ€™ll be grateful for your help. 

Regards Matt
